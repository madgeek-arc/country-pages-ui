        The EOSC Observatory is a policy intelligence tool being developed by the <a href="https://eoscfuture.eu" target="_blank">EOSC Future</a>
        project for monitoring policies, investments, resources, and infrastructures related to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).
        The observatory consists of an interactive dashboard for the collection and presentation of data on the implementation and uptake of
        EOSC at national and organisational levels. The observatory will support European Member States and Associated Countries (MS/AC) and the
        <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en" target="_blank">EOSC Partnership</a> (consisting of the European Commision,
        <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert-groups/consult?lang=en&groupID=3756" target="_blank">EOSC Steering Board</a>,
        and <a href="https://www.eosc.eu" target="_blank">EOSC Association</a>) in their monitoring activities and publicly present the results on the state of EOSC.

        The EOSC Observatory collects data automatically from trusted data sources (such as the <a href="https://eosc-portal.eu" target="_blank">EOSC Portal</a>
        and <a href="https://osobservatory.openaire.eu" target="_blank">OpenAIRE Open Science Observatory</a>) and manually from key EOSC stakeholders.
        The observatory is structured to collect and present data across four key layers as in Figure 1

      <p>The EOSC Observatory is currently in development and the first full release of the dashboard and collected data
        to the public is expected in early 2023. The first collection of data on the indicators for EOSC readiness by the
        EOSC Steering Board and MS/AC (Layer 1), on the indicators for the EOSC Partnership by the EOSC Association and its
        members (Layer 2), and on the contributions to the EOSC Partnership by the EOSC Association and its members (Layer 3)
        are already scheduled to take place in 2022 via targeted surveys and will be repeated on an annual basis to update the data.
